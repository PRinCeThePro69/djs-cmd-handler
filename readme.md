Handler for discord.js version 13 (made in a mix of reconlx and lyxcode's handler)

`npm install` - install all required dependencies

`node index.js` - start the project

Only open pull requests for bug fixes, I want to keep the code as clean as possible, thanks!

*Note:* if you are having problems with the anticrash system, just remove anticrash line from `index.js`.
